🚀 React + Vite Project

Welcome to your next-gen React project, powered by Vite! ⚡ Say goodbye to slow build times and hello to instant HMR (Hot Module Replacement). This setup ensures you're developing at the speed of light. 🚀

📦 Installation & Setup

Getting started is as easy as 1-2-3:

# 1️⃣ Clone this repo

$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
$ cd your-repo

# 2️⃣ Install dependencies

$ npm install # or yarn install / pnpm install

# 3️⃣ Start your dev server

$ npm run dev # or yarn dev / pnpm dev

Vite will spin up a super-fast dev server on http://localhost:5173/ (or whatever port is available). Open it up in your favorite browser and start building! 🏗️
